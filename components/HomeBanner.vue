          (20273,3). Given the widespread and sustained impact of the COVID-19
          Pandemic and numerous other issues related to the same, not the least
          of which is a recent and rapid increase in cases, there is significant
          uncertainty about the current and future state of our local economy.
          It is absolutely necessary to reconsider this project within the
          context of current events, the community’s need, and the Board’s
          priorities over the next several years. To maintain the integrity of
          the process and protect interested proposers, cancelling the
          solicitation before proposals are received is both prudent and
          appropriate. We sincerely appreciate your kind patience and
          consideration in this matter.

              Hillsborough County has a historic opportunity to redevelop the
              site of the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) at 4801 Fowler
              Ave, Tampa, Florida. The County seeks a visionary development
              partner who will leverage the innovation that surrounds the site
              and the area’s booming economy to create an urban, mixed-use hub
              for cutting-edge companies, sustainable living and community
              advancement.
